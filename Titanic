Introduction 
This project aims to predict whether a passenger survived or not during the sinking of the Titanic, based on various features such as age, gender, class, and other attributes. The dataset used for this project is widely known in the data science community and provides a great starting point for beginners to practice data cleaning, visualization, and machine learning.

Project Overview
The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset for binary classification problems. In this project, we explore and process the data to train machine learning models to predict survival. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the survival of passengers based on their characteristics.

Dataset
The dataset used is provided by Kaggle: Titanic Dataset.

Features:
Survived: 0 = No, 1 = Yes (Target variable)
Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Sex: Gender
Age: Age in years
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
Fare: Ticket fare
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
Project Workflow
Data Loading and Cleaning
Load the training and test datasets.
Handle missing data, especially for columns such as Age, Cabin, and Embarked.
Drop or transform columns that aren't useful, like Cabin and Ticket.
Convert categorical features (Sex, Embarked) into numerical values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize survival rates based on features such as Sex, Pclass, Age, and Fare.
Analyze correlations and distributions of passengers who survived vs those who didn't.
Insights gained:
Women had a higher survival rate than men.
Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive than those in 2nd or 3rd class.
Feature Engineering
Family Size: A new feature derived by combining SibSp (siblings/spouses) and Parch (parents/children).
Transforming continuous variables like Age into bins or groups.
Model Building
Logistic Regression:

Used as a baseline model due to its simplicity and interpretability.
Random Forest Classifier:

Chosen for its ability to handle non-linear relationships and feature importance insights.
Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC curve.
Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning were used to avoid overfitting.

Model Evaluation
Evaluated model performance using a validation set.
Analyzed confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curves.
Random Forest model achieved better performance compared to logistic regression in terms of both accuracy and AUC score.
Results
Logistic Regression Accuracy: 0.80
Random Forest Accuracy: 0.84
AUC Score for Random Forest: 0.88
Based on the analysis, Random Forest was the better-performing model, providing a balance between precision and recall, along with a strong AUC score.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the complete workflow for solving a binary classification problem using the Titanic dataset. Through data cleaning, feature engineering, and model selection, we built models that achieved decent accuracy in predicting the survival of passengers. Feature importance analysis showed that Sex, Pclass, and Age were the most significant factors in determining survival.
